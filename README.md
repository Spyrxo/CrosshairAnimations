## Q&A:

**?** Why did you create this mod?
> Was inspired by tinkers construct when using the long bow item. Really liked how the animation played as you charged up the bow.

**?** Will you update the mod to later versions of MC?
> Probably not, I coded this in my spare time as a little side project and I don't really care for later versions of the game. Plus, this is written in Forge, Fabric is way better for mods later on anyways.

**?** Will you fix any major bugs or compatibility errors?
> If its a big bug that affects a lot of people or is detrimental to the overall satisfaction, sure. But if its a small edge case or personal, then not really.

**?** Will you update the mod with new features such as custom user added crosshairs?
> I plan to add a few more features in, such as the ability to add in your own custom animation frames for user created crosshairs. Maybe a special animation state for directly looking at entities. How long that will take though, I am unsure of.
